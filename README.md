# Rocket-Ascent-and-Orbital-Insertion-Simulation
Linear Tangent Guidance for orbital insertion. 
This MATLAB project simulates the ascent trajectory of a two-stage launch vehicle from liftoff to orbital insertion. The simulation models key flight dynamics, including thrust, gravity, and atmospheric drag, with a focus on the guidance strategies used during different phases of the flight.
